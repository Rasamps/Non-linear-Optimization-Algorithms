# Non-linear Optimization Algorithms

This is a MATLAB repository containing non-linear optimization algorithms I completed during my undergraduat degree. Contained within are applied examples of gradient descent, modified descent algorithms, a foundational neural network, least squares regression, and support vector machines.

## Usage

This repository is not intended for use, but as a learning resource to understand how each of these algorithms work. To support this, the folders include a written report summarizing the finer details of each algorithm.

## Contributing

At this time, I ask for pull requests **not to be made** as this is a learning resource and not an ongoing development.
